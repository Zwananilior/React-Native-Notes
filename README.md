# React Native Notes App (Expo + TypeScript)

This is a simple secure notes application for assessment:
- Authentication (register/login) stored in AsyncStorage
- Protected routing (auth flow)
- Notes CRUD with categories, search, sorting, timestamps
- Uses AsyncStorage as the data store

Quick start:
1. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm start` (or `expo start`)
4. Open in simulator or Expo Go.

Notes:
- This project is for educational/demo use and stores credentials in AsyncStorage (not secure for production).
- Files included: App.tsx, src/ (screens, navigation, utils, components)
